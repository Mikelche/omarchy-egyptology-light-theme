# Egyptology Light - A Light Mode Theme for Omarchy
An Omarchy theme inspired by Louis Haghe’s luminous Egypt and Nubia plates — soft desert sands, Nile blues, sun-baked reds and golds. Clear, warm, and calm, like coding from Giza at dusk beneath ancient stone.

## Inspirations
This theme has been inspired by Louis Haghe's lithographs.

### Who was Louis Haghe?
Louis Haghe (1806–1885) was a Belgian lithographer based in London. He became one of the **great masters of early color lithography**, famous for his ability to turn stone-printed plates into vivid, atmospheric scenes.

### Why Egypt?
In the 1840s, Haghe collaborated with artist and explorer **David Roberts**, who traveled through Egypt, Nubia, Sinai, and the Levant. Roberts sketched ancient monuments, tombs, villages, and landscapes.

Haghe transformed these sketches into lush hand-colored lithographs, published in the monumental book set: *“The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt & Nubia”* (1842–1849).
