# Egyptology Light - A Light Mode Theme for Omarchy
An Omarchy theme inspired by Louis Haghe’s luminous Egypt and Nubia plates — soft desert sands, Nile blues, sun-baked reds, and golds. Clear, warm, and calm, like coding from Giza at dusk beneath ancient stone.

## Inspirations
This theme is inspired by (and includes) [Louis Haghe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Haghe)'s lithographs. I first encountered them while browsing a public-domain collection published by the [Cleveland Museum of Art](https://www.clevelandart.org/home) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/collections/e0AVrzNGaFs/egypt-and-nubia).

### Who was Louis Haghe?
Louis Haghe (1806–1885) was a Belgian lithographer based in London. He became one of the **great masters of early color lithography**, famous for his ability to turn stone-printed plates into vivid, atmospheric scenes.

### Why Egypt?
In the 1840s, Haghe collaborated with artist and explorer **David Roberts**, who traveled through Egypt, Nubia, Sinai, and the Levant. Roberts sketched ancient monuments, tombs, villages, and landscapes.

Haghe transformed these sketches into lush hand-colored lithographs, published in the monumental book set: *“The Holy Land, Syria, Idumea, Arabia, Egypt & Nubia”* (1842–1849).
